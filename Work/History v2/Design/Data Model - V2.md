## Summary
Resume points & history summary will be stored for each profile, 
- Fundamentally at the **ASSET** level. 
- As disparate sets of assets in `IN_PROGRESS` and `COMPLETED` states
- Different products will need to have a modified data model, essentially based on how the data needs to be fetched and presented.

The primary set of attributes for an asset resume point will be:

```json
{
    "assetId": "1981",
    "assetType": "tv-episode",
    "totalTime": "PT1H50.04S",
    "state": "In progress",
    "progress": 2518,
    "updateTime": "2021-01-27T23:37:42.155Z"
}
```

`rir:Information`  In Binge we currently also store the necessary hierarchy information which includes fields:

```json
{
    "categoryId": "1446",
    "seasonCategoryId": "1450",
}
```
However, this is primarily done because of demands of the read-path. There is a need to group/filter the assets at one of these hierarchical levels (<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> ‚ö†Ô∏è binge specific </mark>)

 For Kayo this might mean having to do the same in a different manner. For now we know Kayo (and perhaps Flash) needs to do it using:
- The hierarchy (shows)
- Other attributes such as `sport`, `series`, `teams[]` or `season` , etc (`rir:Question` TBD )

## Data model design considerations

The governing aspects for the design would be:
- The way the data needs to be viewed/projected. Behind the scenes, this would mean `viewing-api` would facilitate it with a combination of API calls + filters + aggregation + sorting. 
- DynamoDB storage design & API consideration: In order to make fetch/read data efficiently, it is recommend that `GetItem` requests are made instead of `Query` requests (naturally the queries are slower, with the exception that querying using the partition key for all results can be quicker than a table scan).
	- Therefore the attempt is to ensure we strike a balance between making keyed `GetItem` calls and post processing (filtering/sorting/aggregation)
- We can possibly externalise certain pre-lookups (such as arriving at a limited set of asset IDs) to then get specific history items. 

## How can we narrow down the set of assets that we have to get resume points for from DynamoDB?
There can be a couple of different approaches to this depending on the use case (or across all use cases)

Some known use cases (`rir:Information` with potentially more for Kayo and/or Flash):
1. Get viewing history for a particular show (in which case the show category ID will be known)
2. Get viewing history for a particular show & season (in which case the show & season category IDs will be known)
3. `fas:FileImport`  Get the entire viewing history (Resume/Watched) - Special case wherein no identifiers or contextual information is known. This would perhaps be addressed using a two-step approach involving:
	- Fetch all history (`IN_PROGRESS` or `COMPLETED`) for a profile
	- Apply any aggregation/filtering/sorting rules to it


### Approach 1
- Ensure that we have enough information within the history row so that we can 'post-process' in order to achieve the desired viewing history output. This would mean embedding additional attributes which would then facilitate aggregation/filtering/sorting of the retrieved history rows.

| | If pagination is to be supported, would make it cumbersome to implement such a feature. |
| | Requires the data model to be customised per product (since looking up viewing history may be different for different products). |


### Approach 2
- Include minimal information (mostly pertaining to the resume point & status) within the history row, but establish a mechanism elsewhere (*prior*) to _reach specific history rows (assets)_ for a given profile. 
- This could be done in any manner that's suitable, such as, having an API that can provide such a service for every use case, or by having some summary/meta information within DynamoDB itself that can help with such a navigation.

üåü   We can potentially leverage the current VCC Discovery API to facilitate such a lookup.
Sample queries using VCC Discovery API:
-   [Fetch all assets for sport=afl](https://kayo.content-discovery.cf.streamotion-prod.vmnd.tv/api/v1/assets/search?query=sport:afl&page%5Bsize%5D=50&page%5Bnumber%5D=1&fields=id,description,category.* "https://kayo.content-discovery.cf.streamotion-prod.vmnd.tv/api/v1/assets/search?query=sport:afl&page%5Bsize%5D=50&page%5Bnumber%5D=1&fields=id,description,category.*")
-   [Fetch all assets for show:1207](https://ares.content-discovery.cf.streamotion-prod.vmnd.tv/api/v1/assets/search?query=(category.path:1207)&page%5Bsize%5D=50&page%5Bnumber%5D=1&extraFields=markers&fields=id,description,category.* "https://ares.content-discovery.cf.streamotion-prod.vmnd.tv/api/v1/assets/search?query=(category.path:1207)&page%5Bsize%5D=50&page%5Bnumber%5D=1&extraFields=markers&fields=id,description,category.*")

### Approach 3
- As a compromise, we could have combination of Option 1 and Option 2, wherein we partly do pre-lookups to narrow down the resume points (assets) based on the lookup flow and additionally perform post-processing to aggregate/filter/sort as required.

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provides the best of both options in a way and a healthy balance could be achieved between the two. | It's not completely generalised, therefore still requires product specific data model customisations. |
| Keeping the post-processing is kept minimal or small enough would imply faster lookups. |  |


## Proposed

A single data record for a viewing history entry needs to contain 2 sets of fields:
- The viewing history related information
- Any extended set of attributes which assist in performing post-processing over history - aggregation/sorting/filtering.
- A _summary_ list of

#### üöß   WIP:

- ü§î  Can we look at storing assets using hierarchical keys such that we can make range queries efficiently. See: [DynamoDB: Best Practices for using sort keys to organise data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-sort-keys.html)
- ü§î  Can we utilise Global or Local Secondary Indexes to provide for dimensional queries (hierarchical perhaps). See: [DynamoDB: General guidelines for secondary indexes in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-indexes-general.html)
- ü§î  Can we use DynamoDB streams and lambdas to perform aggregations? This might be helpful if we want to retain a summary/collection of `assetIds` (and/or `categoryId`s) per profile for query/join purposes. See: [DynamoDB: Using Global Secondary Indexes for materialised aggregation queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-gsi-aggregation.html)

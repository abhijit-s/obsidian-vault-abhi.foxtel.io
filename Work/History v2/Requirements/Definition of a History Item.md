### History Item Definition

- The definition of a single item of viewing history would depend on the product's definition. 
- However, simplistically, this would imply the highest level of aggregation applied to the profile's history items when returning the API response (viewing api). Thus, for example, in Binge this would mean that the single item is for a show or a movie.
- Pagination implementation will therefore have to account for such semantics.

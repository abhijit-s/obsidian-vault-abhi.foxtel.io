**Query endpoint(s):**

* New endpoint to get assets based on `category.path` using vcc discovery
* New endpoint to get assets using a specific attribute (ex: `sport=afl`) using vcc discovery
* Ability in the above endpoints to project payload fields (using the `fields` attribute)
* Enhancing the GET Asset API to pass on the `category.path` as returned by VCC Discovery API

**OR**Â 
-   General purpose query endpoint (unlike the current one which enriches the content further), which simply passes on queries to VCC in their raw format
